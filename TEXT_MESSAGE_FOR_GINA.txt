Hey Gina! 👋

Your new recruiting CRM is almost ready! Before I send you the link, can you do one quick setup step?

📧 CREATE GMAIL APP PASSWORD (takes 5 min):

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

2. Sign in with gina.ortiz.sfg@gmail.com

3. You might need to enable 2-Step Verification first (Google will walk you through it)

4. Then:
   - Click "Select app" → choose "Mail"
   - Click "Select device" → choose "Other"
   - Type: "AutoMentor CRM"
   - Click "Generate"

5. SAVE THE 16-DIGIT PASSWORD (looks like: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx)
   - Screenshot it or write it down
   - You won't be able to see it again!

This lets your CRM send follow-up emails automatically from your Gmail.

Once you have the password, text me back and I'll send you the dashboard link! 🚀

The dashboard will let you:
✅ Track all recruits in one place
✅ See pipeline stages
✅ Send follow-ups with one click
✅ View weekly stats
✅ Track conversations

Let me know when you're ready! 📱
