# AutoMentor CRM - Setup Instructions for Gina

Hey Gina! 👋 Here's your new recruiting CRM dashboard. Follow these quick steps to get set up:

## 📧 Step 1: Create Gmail App Password (5 minutes)

Your CRM can send follow-up emails automatically. To enable this:

1. **Go to your Google Account**: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. **Sign in** with your Gmail account (gina.ortiz.sfg@gmail.com)

3. **Create an App Password**:

   - You might need to enable 2-Step Verification first (Google will guide you)
   - Click "Select app" → Choose "Mail"
   - Click "Select device" → Choose "Other (Custom name)"
   - Type: "AutoMentor CRM"
   - Click "Generate"

4. **Copy the 16-character password** (looks like: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx)
   - ⚠️ **SAVE THIS PASSWORD** - you'll need it in Step 2!
   - You won't be able to see it again

## 🚀 Step 2: Access Your Dashboard

Once I deploy the app, I'll send you:

- **Your dashboard URL** (looks like: https://automentor-crm.onrender.com)
- **Instructions to add your email password** (takes 2 minutes)
